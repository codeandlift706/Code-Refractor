## Description
The goal of refractoring this web page is to increase accessibility to the HTML and CSS components used to create and format the web page. HTML semantic elements are used to easily identify the structure of the web page to help facilitate future edits as needed. The content of the web page itself provides information on Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, Social Media Marketing, Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management. 
The deployed application can be found here: https://codeandlift706.github.io/Code-Refractor/.
